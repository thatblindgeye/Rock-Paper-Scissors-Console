        Right click anywhere within the page, select "Inspect" or "Inspect
        Element", and go to the "Console" tab in the Developer Tools window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type "game()", without the quotations, inside the console and a popup
        will appear to begin the game!
      </p>
      <p>
        For ease of play, it is best to dock both windows side by side, or use
        two monitors, so that you can see both the console where the game will
        be outpu to and the prompt to enter your selection at the same time.
